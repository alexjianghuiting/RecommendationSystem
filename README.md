# RecommendationSystem
Simulation of Online Recommendation System

• Built an online training model (SimilarItem Model) for non-registered users to provide them item-based
recommendation

• Built off-line learning models for each registered user (CFmodel, Clustering model, KNN model) to
provide them both user-based and item-based recommendation

• Implemented Collaborative Filtering model by using SVD to extract items' key feature values to predict
rare items' ratings

• Used K-nearest-neighbors model (KNN model) to find similar users based on users' features and
provide recommendation based on similar users' rating matrix

• Built a SimilarItem model to group items with similar features by using K-means and provide online
recommendation by returning all the cluster members
